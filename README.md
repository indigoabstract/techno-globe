# app-plex

app-plex is a general purpose tool for rapid prototyping any type of applications in C++.
It helps you keep all the apps/demos you accumulate in one place and immediately deployable on any supported platform.


No more lost or misplaced works!


Includes a minimal 3D engine, OpenGL graphics, playing sounds and loading resources/images.
Atm, it works on Windows and Android.


# Getting Started

I use CMake GUI to build a Visual Studio project out of the source files.

It looks like this:

![CMake params](cmake-ss.png?raw=true "CMake params")

Download CMake here:

# Future work:

- WebGL support, to run apps in the browser
- iOS/macOS support
- Public apps, so you can share them (with a link), or private apps, to keep them just for yourself.
